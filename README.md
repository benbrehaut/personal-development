# Personal Development
A repo for my personal development. Inspired by Una Kravets open sourcing of her own personal goals, I decided to put my up here, on Github!

Some things I have slightly changed from Una's original one.

This is for development for myself, and nothing about personal life (such as visit e.x. place.. etc.)
Instead of weekly sprints, I have decided to do monthly, due to personal commitments. I hope to change this back to a week soon.

# Goals (2017)
1. Use more JavaScript instead of jQuery
2. Learn about ES5, ES6 (or what ever it is called now..)
3. Learn more of PHP
4. Learn more about React / Vue / Angular and create a app with one of them.
