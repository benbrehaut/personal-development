# Personal Development
A repo for my personal development. Inspired by Una Kravets open sourcing of her own personal goals, I decided to put my up here, on Github!

Some things I have slightly changed from Una's original one.

- [ ] This is for development for myself, and nothing about personal life (such as visit e.x. place.. etc.)
- [ ] Instead of weekly sprints, I have decided to do monthly, due to personal commitments. I hope to change this back to a week soon.

# Goals (2017)
1. Use more JavaScript instead of jQuery
